# Check Your Pecs!

Check your Pecs is a website dedicated to raising awareness about breast cancer in men over 60. Our goal is to provide practical tips and advice on how to check yourself, how often and what you should do if you're worried about something.
We have added a Resources page for further reading and support. The page consists of links to various websites, social media support groups and news paper articles 
from male survivors of breast cancer.
The images on the website are to reflect males over 60 in a positive light and to show that taking care of your body no matter what age, is simply a good thing to do for yourself.
Check Your Pecs is a fully responsive site.

## Design
--------------
- __Typography__

  - For the main title and subsequent headings we chose the "Government-Agent" font from [1001 Free Fonts](https://www.1001freefonts.com/government-agent.font).
  - This font is in a masculine style which we hope will appeal to our target audience.

- __Colour Scheme__

  - We thought about the colours and decided a masculine colour would be more suitable than the normal pink breast cancer colour schemes, because we're  specifically raising awareness for male breast cancer.
  - A blog post from a reputable marketing company led us to the "masculine" colours we chose which we hope will help to make more men feel comfortable looking at this information. ![Blog Post](https://hookagency.com/blog/masculine-color-schemes/)
  - One of the colours they listed is also a shade of pink which we felt helps to link back to the wider breast cancer awareness community.

![Colour Scheme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62209464/141690396-ad620b3b-a5c7-40b5-bcd2-c8a6e725389b.jpg)

 ### __Imagery__
 - We chose images to relect males over 60 in a positive and healthy light.
 - The diagram images are simple and to the point.
