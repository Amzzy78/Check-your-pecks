For example; Love Running is a site that hopes to help keep people motivated to meet up for runs on a regular basis in Dublin, Ireland. The site will be targeted toward runners who are looking for a way to socialise and keep themselves fit. Love Running will be useful for runners to see exactly when and where they should be to join the running club.

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

- __Typography__

  - For the main title and subsequent headings we chose the "Government-Agent" font from [1001 Free Fonts](https://www.1001freefonts.com/government-agent.font).
  - This font is in a masculine style which we hope will appeal to our target audience.

- __Colour Scheme__

  - We thought about the colours and decided a masculine colour would be more suitable than the normal pink breast cancer colour schemes, because we're specifically raising awareness for male breast cancer.
  - A blog post from a reputable marketing company led us to the "masculine" colours we chose which we hope will help to make more men feel comfortable looking at this information. ![Blog Post](https://hookagency.com/blog/masculine-color-schemes/)
  - One of the colours they listed is also a shade of pink which we felt helps to link back to the wider breast cancer awareness community.
