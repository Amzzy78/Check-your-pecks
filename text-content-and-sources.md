Check your Pecks

- How to check yourself

1. Check your pecs (breasts) in front of a mirror for any symptoms or abnormalities.
2. Examine the nipple, most men find their lumps under the nipple.
3. In a sitting or standing position, use the pads of the three middle fingers - examine using light, medium and deep pressure.
4. Examining starts at the collarbone and continues down and up the entire breast in a vertical pattern.
5. Position yourself in bed which leads to a more even distribution of your breast tissue. Repeat step 3 and 4.

- Prevention

Nobody can say for sure the exact cause of breast cancer in men so prevention methods are hard to say.
What we do know is that higher levels of estrogen (or oestrogen) increase your risk of getting it, so preventing higher levels of estrogen is something we can do.

Some common causes of estrogen are Obesity, Stress and Cirrhosis of the liver, so losing weight, not drinking too much alcohol and eating a balanced diet may help prevent male breast cancer.
