            <h2>How to check yourself</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Check your pecs (breasts) in front of a mirror for any symptoms or abnormalities.</li>
                <li>Examine the nipple, most men find their lumps under the nipple.</li>
                <li>In a sitting or standing position, use the pads of the three middle fingers - examine using light, medium and deep pressure.</li>
                <li>Examining starts at the collarbone and continues down and up the entire breast in a vertical pattern.</li>
                <li>Position yourself in bed which leads to a more even distribution of your breast tissue. Repeat step 3 and 4.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>Nobody can say for sure the exact cause of breast cancer in men so prevention methods are hard to say.
                <br>What we do know is that higher levels of estrogen (or oestrogen) increase your risk of getting it, 
                so preventing higher levels of estrogen is something we can do.</p>
            <p>Some common causes of estrogen are Obesity, Stress and Cirrhosis of the liver, so losing weight, not 
                drinking too much alcohol and eating a balanced diet may help prevent male breast cancer.</p>
