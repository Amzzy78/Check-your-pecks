                    The risk of breast cancer increases as you age. Male breast cancer is most often
                    diagnosed in men in their 60s.<br><br>
                    If you take estrogen-related drugs, such as those used for hormone therapy for
                    prostate cancer, your risk of breast cancer is increased.
                    If you have a close family member with breast cancer, you have a
                    greater chance of developing the disease.<br><br>
                    This genetic Klinefelter's syndrome occurs when boys are born with more than one copy of
                    the X chromosome. It causes abnormal development of the testicles. As a result,
                    men with this syndrome produce lower levels of certain male hormones (androgens) and more female
                    hormones (estrogens).<br><br>
                    Certain conditions, such as cirrhosis of the liver, can reduce male hormones and
                    increase female hormones, increasing your risk of breast cancer.<br><br>
                    Obesity is associated with higher levels of estrogen in the body, which increases the risk
                    of male breast cancer.<br><br>
                    Testicle disease or surgery. Having inflamed testicles (orchitis) or surgery to remove a testicle
                    (orchiectomy) can increase your risk of male breast cancer.

                    <p>Nobody can say for sure the exact cause of breast cancer in men so prevention methods are hard to
                        say.<br>
                        <br>What we do know is that higher levels of estrogen (or oestrogen) increase your risk,
                        so preventing those higher levels is something we <em>can</em> do.<br>
                        <br>Common causes of estrogen include Obesity, Stress and Cirrhosis of the liver, so losing
                        weight, not
                        drinking too much alcohol and eating a balanced diet may help to prevent male breast cancer.</p>

                    <p class="p-mid">Checking your Pecs regularly is vital so that you understand the normal look and
                        feel of them.
                        You'll more easily be able to identify any abnormalities and catch the changes as soon as
                        possible.</p><br>
                    <p class="p-mid">It is believed that breast cancer is only for women, because men do not have breast
                        like
                        women, but they certainly have breast tissue.
                        Therefore they can also have breast cancer.<br> Although breast cancer is a rare disease in men
                        and
                        it is a percentage of all types of breast cancers.
                        Its diagnosis is significantly less compared to women.</p>
