            <li>
                <ol>Check your pecs (breasts) in front of a mirror for any symptoms or abnormalities.</ol>
                <ol>Examine the nipple, most men find their lumps under the nipple.</ol>
                <ol>In a sitting or standing position, use the pads of the three middle fingers - examine using light, medium and deep pressure.</ol>
                <ol>Examining starts at the collarbone and continues down and up the entire breast in a vertical pattern.</ol>
                <ol>Position yourself in bed which leads to a more even distribution of your breast tissue. Repeat step 3 and 4.</ol>
