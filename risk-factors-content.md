## Risk Factors

### Radiation exposure
### High levels of the hormone estrogen
### Family history of breast cancer, especially breast cancer that is related to the BRCA2 gene.

### How can you be exposed to radiation?
#### Radioactive materials give off a form of energy that travels in waves or particles. This energy is called radiation. When a person is exposed to radiation, the energy penetrates the body. For example, when a person has an x-ray, he or she is exposed to radiation.

### What causes high levels of the hormone estrogen in males?
#### Aging: We are all aware of the fact that as the years pass by, one has to go through a lot of hormonal changes. With age, the estrogen levels in a man's body increase and testosterone levels decrease. This is an inevitable truth and one has to go through this.

#### Aromatase enzyme: This is an enzyme that converts the androgens into estrogen. This causes a rise in the estrogen level which is again a serious problem. With age, lifestyle, and other factors our body naturally increases the amount of aromatase enzyme which leads to the high amount of unwanted estrogen hormone in the body.

#### Diet: Our diet has a direct effect on the estrogen production in the body. Consuming a diet high in refined carbohydrates can increase the body fat. The body fat contains the aromatase enzyme. For this reason, as the fat in our body increases, the estrogen level too increases.

#### Stress: A human body releases cortisol hormone under a stressful situation. In men, this hormone suppresses other central hormones such as testosterone. As the testosterone level depletes, the estrogen level soars. Living a stress-free life may not be possible, but mindful management of stress is certainly possible.

#### Excessive fat: As mentioned earlier, fat can produce estrogen. Men with increased fat in the waist area are at high risk of estrogen dominance in their body.

#### Testosterone replacement therapy: Men experience low libido or erectile dysfunction due to a dip in their testosterone hormone. If the doctors prescribe the testosterone supplements without checking the real cause for the dip, it can lead to several other health issues. Too much of testosterone can lead to an increase in aromatase enzyme. This, in turn, increases the amount of estrogen in the body which is again problematic

#### Xenoestroegens: The toxic chemicals from plastics, heavy metals, cosmetic and body care products contain endocrine disruptors or xenoestrogens. These xenoestrogens increase the production of estrogen in the body.

### How do you know if you have the BRCA2 gene?
#### The BRCA gene test is most often a blood test. A doctor, nurse or medical technician inserts a needle into a vein, usually in your arm, to draw the blood sample needed for testing. The sample is sent to a lab for DNA analysis. In some cases, other sample types are collected for DNA analysis, including saliva.
#### The BRCA gene test is offered to those who are likely to have an inherited mutation based on personal or family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer.
